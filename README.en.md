## What is Project Golem?

Project Golem is not just a chatbot. It is an executable AI work system.  
It combines language model intelligence with operational tooling so you can run real workflows from a single dashboard:

- Live conversations and task collaboration
- Skill loading and tool expansion (MCP / Skills)
- Long-term memory management and retrieval
- Multi-agent discussions and consensus output
- Text RPG, stock board, collaborative calendar, and Bond Journal
- Security controls, configuration, updates, and operations

You can run it with:

- `Gemini Web` (Browser-in-the-Loop via Playwright)
- `Ollama` (local/private models)
- `LM Studio` (OpenAI-compatible local API)

---

## Why it matters

Many AI tools are great for one-shot prompts, but weak for continuous work. Project Golem is designed for sustained use in real environments:

- Stateful: keeps long-term context and memory
- Actionable: executes tasks through tools and skills
- Governed: includes operation boundaries and safety checks
- Operable: managed through a full web dashboard

---

## Good fits

| Use case | What Golem provides |
| --- | --- |
| Personal AI workspace | Centralizes chat, memory, tools, and settings in one dashboard instead of scattering work across AI tabs. |
| Local/private AI | Runs with Ollama or LM Studio so model calls and memory data can stay on your own machine or private network. |
| Long-running projects | Keeps project context through memory, summaries, and skills instead of asking you to repeat the same background every time. |
| Multi-agent decisions | Spins up role-based discussions such as product, engineering, security, and operations, then turns them into concrete conclusions. |
| Tool-oriented agent experiments | Uses MCP and Skills to connect search, files, external services, and project tools into the AI workflow. |
| Life and creative companionship | Uses Text RPG, Bond Journal, and collaborative calendar flows to turn the AI from a utility into a shared planning and recording partner. |
| Market analysis cockpit | Uses Taiwan/US stock boards to collect quotes, news, indicators, and watchlists, then hands the snapshot to Golem for analysis. |

---

## Core capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-backend brain | Switch between `gemini`, `ollama`, and `lmstudio` by cost, privacy, or performance needs. |
| Web Dashboard | Default at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` for chat, monitoring, settings, skills, MCP, and memory management. |
| Long-term memory | Supports `lancedb-pro` and `native` memory modes with retrieval and summarization workflows. |
| Multi-agent collaboration | Interactive Multi-Agent mode for role-based discussion and consensus synthesis. |
| Skill system | Load built-in or custom skills, with install/enable/test management flow. |
| MCP expansion | Connect standard I/O MCP servers to extend real-world tool access. |
| Stock board | Taiwan/US watchlists, quotes, candlesticks, technical indicators, news context, and Golem-ready analysis snapshots. |
| Collaborative calendar | Dashboard calendar for creating, updating, and deleting events while exposing schedule context to Golem. |
| Text RPG | Native text RPG mode with world/character setup, choice interaction, membership turns, and external channel binding. |
| Bond Journal | User diary, AI diary, AI thoughts, weekly summaries, bond levels, SQLite backup, and restore workflows. |
| External channels | Optional Telegram / Discord bridges. |
| Security governance | Remote access protection, operation token checks, and risky command safeguards. |

## Quick start

### 1) Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=20 <23`
- npm
- Chromium / Google Chrome (required for Gemini Web mode)

### 2) Install and run

```bash
npm install

## Deployment

For local development and personal use, running the Node.js runtime directly is recommended. For server or VPS deployment, the repo also includes Docker Compose and headless/noVNC oriented flows.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

See [Docker Local Deployment Guide](docs/DOCKER-LOCAL.zh-TW.md) and [VPS VNC Setup Guide](docs/VPS_VNC_Setup_Guide.md) for details.
